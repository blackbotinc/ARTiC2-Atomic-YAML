## ARTiC2 ATOMICS

ARTiC2 Atomics are red team atomic tests forked from [@redcanaryco](https://github.com/redcanaryco) that are used by ARTiC2 to dynamically build fire-and-forget powershell versions of each atomic test from memory. All are mapped to [Mitre's ATT&CK](https://attack.blackbot.io). 


## HOW THEY'RE USED

For each atomic test case, ARTiC2 reads the YAML files stored in each Atomic folder to dynamically build corresponding powershell scripts.
